# 🚀 30 Days of Jenkins & AWS DevOps Challenge 🚀  

Welcome to my **#30DaysOfJenkins** journey! This repository chronicles my mission to master **Jenkins CI/CD pipelines** and **AWS DevOps** through hands-on learning. Over the next 30 days, I’ll tackle **60 real-world projects** that combine cloud engineering, automation, and best DevOps practices.

## 🌟 Challenge Overview  

### 🎯 **Daily Plan**  
Each day consists of:  
- ✅ **AWS Project**: Build and deploy cloud infrastructure.  
- ✅ **Jenkins Project**: Automate CI/CD pipelines to streamline workflows.  

### 🛠️ **Tools in Focus**  
This challenge dives deep into:  
- **Jenkins**: Pipelines, plugins, integrations, and troubleshooting.  
- **AWS Services**:  
  - Core: S3, EC2, Lambda, EKS, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation.  
  - Advanced: Serverless, monitoring, and Kubernetes.  
- **DevOps Toolkit**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, SonarQube, Nexus, Grafana, Prometheus, K8sGPT, Kubecost.

## 🧠 Jenkins Mastery: Interview Questions  

To cement my knowledge, I’ll tackle key Jenkins interview questions, including:  
- **Day 2**: “How do you securely manage secrets in Jenkins pipelines?”  
- **Day 7**: “Explain Jenkins agents and their use in Kubernetes environments.”  
- **Day 15**: “What strategies can optimize a slow Jenkins pipeline?”  
- **Day 22**: “How do you integrate Jenkins with Grafana for monitoring?”  
- **Day 30**: “Can Jenkins and GitOps coexist? If so, how?”
