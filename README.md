# 🚀 30 Days of Jenkins & AWS DevOps 🚀  

Welcome to my **#30DaysOfJenkins** journey! This repository showcases my progress as I dive into Jenkins CI/CD and AWS DevOps by completing **60 hands-on projects** in just 30 days.  

## What’s Inside  

### 📅 Daily Schedule  
Every day consists of two exciting challenges:  
1. **AWS Project**: Building real-world cloud infrastructure on AWS.  
2. **Jenkins Project**: Crafting and automating CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins.  

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools  
Throughout this challenge, I’ll explore:  
- **Jenkins**: Pipelines, plugins, integrations, and debugging techniques.  
- **AWS**: Core services like S3, EC2, Lambda, EKS, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation, and more.  
- **DevOps Toolkit**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, SonarQube, Nexus, Grafana, Prometheus, K8sGPT, Kubecost.  

## 📂 Repository Organization  
Each day’s progress is neatly organized into its own folder:  
- **AWS Project**: Contains all code and documentation for AWS infrastructure tasks.  
- **Jenkins Project**: Includes pipeline scripts, configurations, and related files.  

## 📝 Sample Projects  

Here’s a snapshot of what I’ll be working on:  

| Day | AWS Task                                      | Jenkins Task                                                 | Tools Used                     |  
|-----|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| 1   | Deploy a static website using S3 and CloudFront. | Create a Jenkins job to clone a GitHub repo and execute a shell script. | S3, CloudFront, Jenkins, GitHub. |  
| 2   | Launch an EC2 instance with a Tomcat server.  | Build and deploy a WAR file to the server using a Jenkins pipeline. | EC2, Tomcat, Jenkins, SSH.     |  
| 3   | Set up a private Docker registry in ECR.      | Automate Docker image builds and push them to ECR via Jenkins. | ECR, Docker, Jenkins.          |  
| 4   | Deploy a Lambda function via AWS CLI.         | Integrate Jenkins with SonarQube to scan Lambda code.         | Lambda, SonarQube, Jenkins.    |  
| 5   | Create a VPC with Terraform.                  | Use Jenkins to run `terraform apply` and deploy infrastructure. | Terraform, VPC, Jenkins.       |  
| ... | ...                                          | ...                                                         | ...                            |  
| 30  | Implement GitOps with FluxCD on EKS.          | Use Jenkins to sync with FluxCD and audit changes using K8sGPT. | FluxCD, EKS, K8sGPT, Jenkins.  |  

## 🌟 What I’ll Learn  

By the end of this challenge, I’ll have gained:  
- **Jenkins Expertise**: Mastering pipelines, plugins, integrations, and secure practices.  
- **AWS Proficiency**: Deep understanding of cloud infrastructure and serverless technologies.  
- **DevOps Best Practices**: Advanced CI/CD workflows, GitOps, and disaster recovery strategies.  

## 🧠 Bonus: Jenkins Interview Prep  

To solidify my learning, I’ll tackle key interview questions related to Jenkins:  
- Day 2: “How do you manage secrets in Jenkins pipelines?”  
- Day 7: “What are Jenkins agents, and how do they work in Kubernetes?”  
- Day 15: “What strategies do you use to optimize slow Jenkins pipelines?”  
- Day 22: “How do you integrate Jenkins with Grafana for real-time monitoring?”  
- Day 30: “Can Jenkins coexist with GitOps? Explain.”
