## 🌟 What I’ll Achieve

🎓 By the end of this challenge, I’ll have mastered:

1. 🏆 **Jenkins Expertise**: Advanced pipeline creation, plugin usage, and secure automation practices.
2. 🌐 **AWS Proficiency**: Building scalable, secure cloud systems.
3. 🤖 **DevOps Skills**: CI/CD, GitOps, and disaster recovery workflows.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Jenkins Interview Prep

Throughout the journey, I’ll tackle common Jenkins interview questions, such as:

- Day 2: **“How do you securely manage secrets in Jenkins pipelines?”**
- Day 7: **“How does Jenkins integrate with Kubernetes for agent management?”**
- Day 15: **“What are your strategies for optimizing slow Jenkins pipelines?”**
- Day 22: **“How do you connect Jenkins with Grafana for real-time monitoring?”**
- Day 30: **“Can Jenkins and GitOps coexist? If so, how?”**
